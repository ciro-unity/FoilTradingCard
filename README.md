A foil card shader made for the Foil Trading Card challenge by [Harry Alisavakis](https://twitter.com/HarryAlisavakis) on Twitter, in April 2021.
The scene is provided as-is, just for the purpose of exploring it and learning. Some tricks explained [in this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/CiroContns/status/1386330644570071046).

Additional art (the character, the icons) coming from Unity's first [Open Project](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1), "Chop Chop".

Minimum version: **Unity 2021.1.4f**.
